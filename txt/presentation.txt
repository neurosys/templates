What do I want to transmit?
To whom?
What background do they have?
What would be the minimum information I want them to remember?
Why do they need to learn / read my presentation?

[Guideline]
- No more than 20 words per page
- Think about topic transitions
- Images give easyer understanding than text (use images that give meaning)
- Create a consistent look and feel (use same fonts, and colors across presentation)
